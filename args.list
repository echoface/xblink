aec_untrusted_delay_for_testing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/modules/audio_processing/BUILD.gn:17

    Disables the usual mode where we trust the reported system delay
    values the AEC receives. The corresponding define is set appropriately
    in the code, but it can be force-enabled here for testing.

allow_posix_link_time_opt
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:16

    Enable Link Time Optimization in optimized builds (output programs run
    faster, but linking is up to 5-20x slower).
    Note: use target_os == "linux" rather than is_linux so that it does not
    apply to host_toolchain when target_os="android".

android_full_debug
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:33

    Normally, Android builds are lightly optimized, even for debug builds, to
    keep binary size down. Setting this flag to true disables such optimization

apm_debug_dump
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:72

    Selects whether debug dumps for the audio processing module
    should be generated.

    Detect overflow/underflow for global objects.
   
    Mac: http://crbug.com/352073

auto_profile_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:92

    AFDO (Automatic Feedback Directed Optimizer) is a form of profile-guided
    optimization that GCC supports. It used by ChromeOS in their official
    builds. To use it, set auto_profile_path to the path to a file containing
    the needed gcov profiling data.

binutils_path
    Current value (from the default) = "../../third_party/binutils/Linux_x64/Release/bin"
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:42

blink_gc_plugin
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/WebKit/Source/BUILD.gn:17

    Set to true to enable the clang plugin that checks the usage of the  Blink
    garbage-collection infrastructure during compilation.

blink_gc_plugin_option_do_dump_graph
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/WebKit/Source/BUILD.gn:21

    Set to true to have the clang Blink GC plugin emit class graph (in JSON)
    with typed pointer edges; for debugging or other (internal) uses.

blink_gc_plugin_option_use_chromium_style_naming
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/WebKit/Source/BUILD.gn:31

    Set to true to have the clang Blink GC plugin use Chromium-style naming
    rather than legacy Blink name.
    TODO(https://crbug.com/675879): Remove this option after the Blink rename.

blink_gc_plugin_option_warn_unneeded_finalizer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/WebKit/Source/BUILD.gn:26

    Set to true to have the clang Blink GC plugin additionally check if
    a class has an empty destructor which would be unnecessarily invoked
    when finalized.

blink_logging_always_on
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/WebKit/Source/config.gni:22

    If true, enables WTF::ScopedLogger unconditionally.
    When false, WTF::ScopedLogger is enabled only if assertions are enabled.

build_angle_deqp_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/src/tests/BUILD.gn:204

    Don't build dEQP by default.

build_libsrtp_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libsrtp/BUILD.gn:10

    Tests may not be appropriate for some build environments, e.g. Windows.
    Rather than enumerate valid options, we just let clients ask for them.

build_sfntly_samples
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/sfntly/BUILD.gn:9

    Flip to true to build sfntly sample programs.

build_with_mozilla
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:94

    Enable to use the Mozilla internal settings.

cc_wrapper
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/toolchain/cc_wrapper.gni:36

    Set to "ccache", "icecc" or "distcc".  Probably doesn't work on windows.

chrome_pgo_phase
    Current value (from the default) = 0
      From //build/config/compiler/pgo/pgo.gni:13

    Specify the current PGO phase.
    Here's the different values that can be used:
        0 : Means that PGO is turned off.
        1 : Used during the PGI (instrumentation) phase.
        2 : Used during the PGO (optimization) phase.
   
    TODO(sebmarchand): Add support for the PGU (update) phase.

clang_base_path
    Current value (from the default) = "//third_party/llvm-build/Release+Asserts"
      From //build/config/clang/clang.gni:12

clang_use_chrome_plugins
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/clang/clang.gni:10

    Indicates if the build should use the Chrome-specific plugins for enforcing
    coding guidelines, etc. Only used when compiling with Clang.

clang_version
    Current value (from the default) = "5.0.0"
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:53

    Clang compiler version. Clang files are placed at version-dependent paths.

compile_credentials
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //sandbox/linux/BUILD.gn:17

compile_suid_client
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //sandbox/linux/BUILD.gn:15

compute_grit_inputs_for_analyze
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //tools/grit/grit_rule.gni:108

    When set, this will fork out to grit at GN-time to get all inputs
    referenced by the .grd file.
   
    Normal builds don't need this since proper incremental builds are handled
    by grit writing out the inputs in .d files at build-time. But for analyze
    to work on the bots, it needs to know about all input files at GN-time so
    it knows which tests to trigger when something changes. This option will
    slow down the GN run.

concurrent_links
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/toolchain/concurrent_links.gni:19

    Limit the number of concurrent links; we often want to run fewer
    links at once than we do compiles, because linking is memory-intensive.
    The default to use varies by platform and by the amount of memory
    available, so we call out to a script to get the right value.

content_shell_product_name
    Current value (from the default) = "Content Shell"
      From //content/shell/BUILD.gn:27

content_shell_version
    Current value (from the default) = "99.77.34.5"
      From //content/shell/BUILD.gn:28

current_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help current_cpu`.)

current_os
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help current_os`.)

custom_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:143

    Allows the path to a custom target toolchain to be injected as a single
    argument, and set as the default toolchain.

dcheck_always_on
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/dcheck_always_on.gni:7

    Set to true to enable dcheck in Release builds.

debug_devtools
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/WebKit/public/public_features.gni:12

    If debug_devtools is set to true, JavaScript files for DevTools are stored
    as is and loaded from disk. Otherwise, a concatenated file is stored in
    resources.pak. It is still possible to load JS files from disk by passing
    --debug-devtools cmdline switch.

disable_brotli_filter
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //net/features.gni:25

    Do not disable brotli filter by default.

disable_ffmpeg_video_decoders
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:99

    On Android, FFMpeg is built without video decoders by default.
    This flag gives the option to override that decision in case there are no
    hardware decoders. To do so, you will also need to update ffmpeg build files
    in order to define which decoders to build in.

disable_file_support
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //net/features.gni:12

    Disables support for file URLs.  File URL support requires use of icu.

disable_ftp_support
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //net/features.gni:17

disable_libfuzzer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:91

    Helper variable for testing builds with disabled libfuzzer.
    Not for client use.

enable_ac3_eac3_audio_demuxing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:39

    Enables AC3/EAC3 audio demuxing. This is enabled only on Chromecast, since
    it only provides demuxing, and is only useful for AC3/EAC3 audio
    pass-through to HDMI sink on Chromecast.

enable_app_list
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:21

enable_background
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:24

    Enables support for background apps.

enable_basic_print_dialog
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:28

    Enable the printing system dialog for platforms that support printing
    and have a system dialog.

enable_basic_printing
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //printing/features/features.gni:10

    Enable basic printing support and UI.

enable_captive_portal_detection
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:30

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:46

    Enable support for the 'cbcs' encryption scheme added by MPEG Common
    Encryption 3rd Edition (ISO/IEC 23001-7), published 02/15/2016.

enable_debugallocation
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //base/allocator/BUILD.gn:13

    Provide a way to force disable debugallocation in Debug builds,
    e.g. for profiling (it's more rare to profile Debug builds,
    but people sometimes need to do that).

enable_dolby_vision_demuxing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:55

    Enable Dolby Vision demuxing. Enable by default for Chromecast. Actual
    decoding must be provided by the platform. Note some Dolby Vision profiles
    which are encoded using HEVC require |enable_hevc_demuxing| to be enabled.

enable_extensions
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //extensions/features/features.gni:8

enable_full_stack_frames_for_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:50

    Compile in such a way as to make it possible for the profiler to unwind full
    stack frames. Setting this flag has a large effect on the performance of the
    generated code than just setting profiling, but gives the profiler more
    information to analyze.
    Requires profiling to be set to true.

enable_google_now
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:34

    Google Now is disabled to prepare for its removal.
    http://crbug.com/539674

enable_hangout_services_extension
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:38

    Hangout services is an extension that adds extra features to Hangouts.
    It is enableable separately to facilitate testing.

enable_hevc_demuxing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:50

    Enable HEVC/H265 demuxing. Actual decoding must be provided by the
    platform. Enable by default for Chromecast.

enable_hls_sample_aes
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:62

    Enable HLS with SAMPLE-AES decryption.
    Enabled by default on the cast desktop implementation to allow unit tests of
    MP2TS parsing support.

enable_hotwording
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:43

    'Ok Google' hotwording is disabled by default. Set to true to enable. (This
    will download a closed-source NaCl module at startup.) Chrome-branded
    ChromeOS builds have this enabled by default.

enable_internal_app_remoting_targets
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //remoting/remoting_options.gni:18

    Set this to enable building internal AppRemoting apps.

enable_ipc_fuzzer
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //tools/ipc_fuzzer/ipc_fuzzer.gni:14

enable_iterator_debugging
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILD.gn:26

    When set (the default) enables C++ iterator debugging in debug builds.
    Iterator debugging is always off in release builds (technically, this flag
    affects the "debug" config, which is always available but applied by
    default only in debug builds).
   
    Iterator debugging is generally useful for catching bugs. But it can
    introduce extra locking to check the state of an iterator against the state
    of the current object. For iterator- and thread-heavy code, this can
    significantly slow execution.

enable_linux_installer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/installer/BUILD.gn:8

enable_mdns
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:28

    Multicast DNS.

enable_media_codec_video_decoder
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/gpu/BUILD.gn:14

    A temporary arg for building MCVD while it's being implemented.
    See http://crbug.com/660942

enable_media_remoting
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:179

    This switch defines whether the Media Remoting implementation will be built.
    When enabled, media is allowed to be renderer and played back on remote
    devices when the tab is being casted and other conditions are met.

enable_media_router
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/features.gni:34

    Enables the Media Router.

enable_memory_task_profiler
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/BUILD.gn:43

    Turn on memory profiling in the task profiler when the heap shim is
    available. Profiling can then be enabled at runtime by passing the command
    line flag --enable-heap-profiling=task-profiler.

enable_mojo_media
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:107

    Experiment to enable mojo media services (e.g. "renderer", "cdm", see
    |mojo_media_services|). When enabled, selected mojo paths will be enabled in
    the media pipeline and corresponding services will hosted in the selected
    remote process (e.g. "utility" process, see |mojo_media_host|).

enable_mojom_typemapping
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //mojo/public/tools/bindings/mojom.gni:14

    Indicates whether typemapping should be supported in this build
    configuration. This may be disabled when building external projects which
    depend on //mojo but which do not need/want all of the Chromium tree
    dependencies that come with typemapping.
   
    Note that (perhaps obviously) a huge amount of Chromium code will not build
    with typemapping disabled, so it is never valid to set this to |false| in
    any Chromium build configuration.

enable_mse_mpeg2ts_stream_parser
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:42

enable_nacl
    Current value = false
      From //out/Xblink/args.gn:10
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/features.gni:27

    Enables Native Client support.
    Temporarily disable nacl on arm64 linux to get rid of compilation errors.
    TODO(mcgrathr): When mipsel-nacl-clang is available, drop the exclusion.

enable_nacl_nonsfi
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/features.gni:31

    Non-SFI is not yet supported on mipsel

enable_nocompile_tests
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/nocompile.gni:63

enable_one_click_signin
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:46

enable_package_mash_services
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:50

    Set to true to bundle all the mash related mojo services into chrome.
    Specify --mash to chrome to have chrome start the mash environment.

enable_pdf
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //pdf/features.gni:12

enable_plugins
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ppapi/features/features.gni:11

enable_precompiled_headers
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/pch.gni:11

    Precompiled header file support is by default available,
    but for distributed build system uses (like goma) or when
    doing official builds.

enable_print_preview
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //printing/features/features.gni:14

    Enable printing with print preview. It does not imply
    enable_basic_printing. It's possible to build Chrome with preview only.

enable_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:25

    Compile in such a way as to enable profiling of the generated code. For
    example, don't omit the frame pointer and leave in symbols.

enable_reading_list
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //components/reading_list/core/reading_list.gni:8

    Controls whether reading list support is active or not. Currently only
    supported on iOS (on other platforms, the feature is always disabled).

enable_remoting
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //remoting/remoting_enable.gni:9

enable_remoting_jscompile
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //remoting/remoting_options.gni:15

    Set this to run the jscompile checks after building the webapp.

enable_resource_whitelist_generation
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/android/config.gni:373

    Enables used resource whitelist generation. Set for official builds only
    as a large amount of build output is generated.

enable_runtime_media_renderer_selection
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:119

    When enabled, this feature allows developers to use a runtime flag to
    choose the implementation of the renderer that is used. On a build which
    enables the mojo renderer, if --disable-mojo-renderer is passed at start-up,
    the "default" renderer will be used instead. Both renderer implementations
    will be linked if this feature is enabled, increasing the binary size. This
    feature does not make sense if the mojo renderer is not enabled.

enable_service_discovery
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:52

enable_session_service
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:56

    Enables use of the session service, which is enabled by default.
    Android stores them separately on the Java side.

enable_supervised_users
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:58

enable_swiftshader
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/gl/BUILD.gn:13

enable_test_mojo_media_client
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:111

    Enable the TestMojoMediaClient to be used in mojo MediaService. This is for
    testing only and will override the default platform MojoMediaClient, if any.

enable_vr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //device/vr/features.gni:10

    Enable WebVR support by default on Android
    Still requires command line flag to access API
    TODO(bshe): Enable for other architecture too. Currently we only support arm
    and arm64.

enable_vr_shell_ui_dev
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:61

    Enables vr shell UI development on local or remote page.

enable_vulkan

enable_webrtc
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:57

enable_websockets
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:16

    WebSockets and socket stream code are not used on iOS and are optional in
    cronet.

enable_widevine
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/widevine/cdm/widevine.gni:7

    Allow widevinecdmadapter to be built in Chromium.

enable_wifi_display
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //extensions/features/features.gni:12

    Enables Wi-Fi Display functionality
    WARNING: This enables MPEG Transport Stream (MPEG-TS) encoding!

enable_xpc_notifications
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:68

    Enable native notifications via XPC services (mac only).
    TODO(miguelg): remove this.

exclude_unwind_tables
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:65

    Omit unwind support in official builds to save space.
    We can use breakpad for these builds.

fatal_linker_warnings
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:81

    Enable fatal linker warnings. Building Chromium with certain versions
    of binutils can cause linker warning.
    See: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=457359

ffmpeg_branding
    Current value (from the default) = "Chromium"
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:34

    Controls whether we build the Chromium or Google Chrome version of FFmpeg.
    The Google Chrome version contains additional codecs. Typical values are
    Chromium, Chrome, and ChromeOS.

fieldtrial_testing_like_official_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:58

    Set to true make a build that disables activation of field trial tests
    specified in testing/variations/fieldtrial_testing_config_*.json.
    Note: this setting is ignored if is_chrome_branded.

full_wpo_on_official
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:72

gcc_target_rpath
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/gcc/BUILD.gn:18

    When non empty, overrides the target rpath value. This allows a user to
    make a Chromium build where binaries and shared libraries are meant to be
    installed into separate directories, like /usr/bin/chromium and
    /usr/lib/chromium for instance. It is useful when a build system that
    generates a whole target root filesystem (like Yocto) is used on top of gn,
    especially when cross-compiling.
    Note: this gn arg is similar to gyp target_rpath generator flag.

gdb_index
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:70

    If true, gold linker will save symbol table inside object files.
    This speeds up gdb startup by 60%

gold_path
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:54

    When we are going to use gold we need to find it.
    This is initialized below, after use_gold might have been overridden.

goma_dir
    Current value (from the default) = "/home/gh/goma"
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:17

    Absolute directory containing the gomacc binary.

google_api_key
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:46

    Set these to bake the specified API keys and OAuth client
    IDs/secrets into your build.
   
    If you create a build without values baked in, you can instead
    set environment variables to provide the keys at runtime (see
    src/google_apis/google_api_keys.h for details).  Features that
    require server-side APIs may fail to work if no keys are
    provided.
   
    Note that if you are building an official build or if
    use_official_google_api_keys has been set to trie (explicitly or
    implicitly), these values will be ignored and the official
    keys will be used instead.

google_default_client_id
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:49

    See google_api_key.

google_default_client_secret
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:52

    See google_api_key.

has_native_accessibility
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //ui/base/ui_features.gni:15

    Whether the platform provides a native accessibility toolkit.

headless_use_embedded_resources
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //headless/headless.gni:7

    Embed resource.pak file into the binary for easier distribution.

host_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = "x64"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_cpu`.)

host_os
    Current value (from the default) = "linux"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_os`.)

host_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:147

    This should not normally be set as a build argument.  It's here so that
    every toolchain can pass through the "global" value via toolchain_args().

icu_use_data_file
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/icu/config.gni:15

    Tells icu to load an external data file rather than rely on the icudata
    being linked directly into the binary.
   
    This flag is a bit confusing. As of this writing, icu.gyp set the value to
    0 but common.gypi sets the value to 1 for most platforms (and the 1 takes
    precedence).
   
    TODO(GYP) We'll probably need to enhance this logic to set the value to
    true or false in similar circumstances.

ignore_elf32_limitations
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:47

    Android 32-bit non-component, non-clang builds cannot have symbol_level=2
    due to 4GiB file size limit, see https://crbug.com/648948.
    Set this flag to true to skip the assertion.

internal_gles2_conform_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //gpu/gles2_conform_support/BUILD.gn:7

    Set to true to compile with the OpenGL ES 2.0 conformance tests.

internal_khronos_glcts_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //gpu/khronos_glcts_support/BUILD.gn:8

is_asan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:10

    Compile for Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs.

is_cast_audio_only
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:14

    Set this true for an audio-only Chromecast build.

is_cast_desktop_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:26

    True if Chromecast build is targeted for linux desktop. This type of build
    is useful for testing and development, but currently supports only a subset
    of Cast functionality. Though this defaults to true for x86 Linux devices,
    this should be overriden manually for an embedded x86 build.
    TODO(slan): Remove instances of this when x86 is a fully supported platform.

is_cast_using_cma_backend
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:65

    If true, use cast CMA backend instead of default chromium media pipeline.

is_cfi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:57

    Compile with Control Flow Integrity to protect virtual calls and casts.
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html
   
    TODO(pcc): Remove this flag if/when CFI is enabled in all official builds.

is_chrome_branded
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chrome_build.gni:9

    Select the desired branding flavor. False means normal Chromium branding,
    true means official Google Chrome branding (requires extra Google-internal
    resources).

is_chromecast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:11

    Set this true for a Chromecast build. Chromecast builds are supported on
    Linux and Android.

is_clang
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:138

    Set to true when compiling with the Clang compiler. Typically this is used
    to configure warnings.

is_component_build
    Current value = false
      From //out/Xblink/args.gn:13
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:164

    Component build. Setting to true compiles targets declared as "components"
    as shared libraries loaded dynamically. This speeds up development time.
    When false, components will be linked statically.
   
    For more information see
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/component_build.md

is_component_ffmpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/ffmpeg/ffmpeg_options.gni:41

    Set true to build ffmpeg as a shared library. NOTE: this means we should
    always consult is_component_ffmpeg instead of is_component_build for
    ffmpeg targets. This helps linux chromium packagers that swap out our
    ffmpeg.so with their own. See discussion here
    https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-packagers/R5rcZXWxBEQ/B6k0zzmJbvcJ

is_debug
    Current value = false
      From //out/Xblink/args.gn:7
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:154

    Debug build. Enabling official builds automatically sets is_debug to false.

is_desktop_linux
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:134

    Whether we're a traditional desktop unix.

is_lsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:13

    Compile for Leak Sanitizer to find leaks.

is_msan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:16

    Compile for Memory Sanitizer to find uninitialized reads.

is_multi_dll_chrome
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chrome_build.gni:13

    Break chrome.dll into multple pieces based on process type. Only available
    on Windows.

is_nacl_glibc
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/nacl/config.gni:11

    Native Client supports both Newlib and Glibc C libraries where Newlib
    is assumed to be the default one; use this to determine whether Glibc
    is being used instead.

is_official_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:131

    Set to enable the official build level of optimization. This has nothing
    to do with branding, but enables an additional level of optimization above
    release (!is_debug). This might be better expressed as a tri-state
    (debug, release, official) but for historical reasons there are two
    separate flags.

is_proto_quic
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //net/features.gni:9

    If true, prune things down as needed for proto-quic build.

is_syzyasan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:51

    Enable building with SyzyAsan which can find certain types of memory
    errors. Only works on Windows. See
    https://github.com/google/syzygy/wiki/SyzyASanHowTo

is_tsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:19

    Compile for Thread Sanitizer to find threading bugs.

is_ubsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:23

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer to find various types of
    undefined behaviour (excludes vptr checks).

is_ubsan_no_recover
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:26

    Halt the program if a problem is detected.

is_ubsan_null
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:29

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's null pointer checks.

is_ubsan_security
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:83

    Enables core ubsan security features. Will later be removed once it matches
    is_ubsan.

is_ubsan_vptr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:32

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's vptr checks.

is_win_fastlink
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:42

    Tell VS to create a PDB that references information in .obj files rather
    than copying it all. This should improve linker performance. mspdbcmf.exe
    can be used to convert a fastlink pdb to a normal one.

libyuv_disable_jpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:15

libyuv_include_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:14

libyuv_use_gflags
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/libyuv/BUILD.gn:14

    Set to false to disable building with gflags.

libyuv_use_msa
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:18

libyuv_use_neon
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libyuv/libyuv.gni:16

link_pulseaudio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //media/media_options.gni:13

    Allows distributions to link pulseaudio directly (DT_NEEDED) instead of
    using dlopen. This helps with automated detection of ABI mismatches and
    prevents silent errors.

linkrepro_root_dir
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:60

    Root directory that will store the MSVC link repro. This should only be
    used for debugging purposes on the builders where a MSVC linker flakyness
    has been observed. The targets for which a link repro should be generated
    should add somethink like this to their configuration:
      if (linkrepro_root_dir != "") {
        ldflags = ["/LINKREPRO:" + linkrepro_root_dir + "/" + target_name]
      }
   
    Note that doing a link repro uses a lot of disk space and slows down the
    build, so this shouldn't be enabled on too many targets.
   
    See crbug.com/669854.

linux_use_bundled_binutils
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:40

llvm_force_head_revision
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:37

    If this is set to true, or if LLVM_FORCE_HEAD_REVISION is set to 1
    in the environment, we use the revision in the llvm repo to determine
    the CLANG_REVISION to use, instead of the version hard-coded into
    //tools/clang/scripts/update.py. This should only be used in
    conjunction with setting LLVM_FORCE_HEAD_REVISION in the
    environment when `gclient runhooks` is run as well.

mac_views_browser
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/base/ui_features.gni:12

    Whether the entire browser uses toolkit-views on Mac instead of Cocoa.

media_use_ffmpeg
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:18

    Enable usage of FFmpeg within the media library. Used for most software
    based decoding, demuxing, and sometimes optimized FFTs. If disabled,

mojo_media_services
    Current value (from the default) = []
      From //media/media_options.gni:141

    A list of mojo media services that should be used in the media pipeline.
    Must not be empty if |enable_mojo_media| is true.
    Valid entries in the list are:
    - "renderer": Use mojo-based media Renderer service.
    - "cdm": Use mojo-based Content Decryption Module.
    - "audio_decoder": Use mojo-based audio decoder in the default media
                       Renderer. Cannot be used with the mojo Renderer above.
    - "video_decoder": Use mojo-based video decoder in the default media
                       Renderer. Cannot be used with the mojo Renderer above.

    branches)

optimize_for_size
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:76

    If true, optimize for size. Does not affect windows builds.
    Linux & Mac favor speed over size.
    TODO(brettw) it's weird that Mac and desktop Linux are different. We should
    explore favoring size over speed in this case as well.

override_build_date
    Current value (from the default) = "N/A"
      From //base/BUILD.gn:38

    Override this value to give a specific build date.
    See //base/build_time.cc and //build/write_build_date_header.py for more
    details and the expected format.

ozone_auto_platforms
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/ozone/ozone.gni:10

      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:42

    Build PDFium standalone

pdf_use_skia
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:33

    Build PDFium against skia (experimental) rather than agg. Use Skia to draw everything.

pdf_use_skia_paths
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:36

    Build PDFium against skia (experimental) rather than agg. Use Skia to draw paths.

pdfium_bundle_freetype
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/pdfium/pdfium.gni:12

    On Android there's no system FreeType. On Windows and Mac, only a few
    methods are used from it.

pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:33

    A pkg-config wrapper to call instead of trying to find and call the right
    pkg-config directly. Wrappers like this are common in cross-compilation
    environments.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:41

    Enables proprietary codecs and demuxers; e.g. H264, AAC, MP3, and MP4.
    We always build Google Chrome and Chromecast with proprietary codecs.
   
    Note: this flag is used by WebRTC which is DEPSed into Chrome. Moving it
    out of //build will require using the build_overrides directory.

remove_webcore_debug_symbols
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/WebKit/Source/config.gni:18

    If true, doesn't compile debug symbols into webcore reducing the

root_extra_deps
    Current value (from the default) = []
      From //BUILD.gn:32

    A list of extra dependencies to add to the root target. This allows a
    checkout to add additional targets without explicitly changing any checked-
    in files.

rtc_build_expat
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:81

    Set this to disable building with support for SCTP data channels.

rtc_include_ilbc
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:172

    Include the iLBC audio codec?

rtc_include_internal_audio_device
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:181

    Chromium uses its own IO handling, so the internal ADM is only built for
    standalone WebRTC.

rtc_include_opus
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:37

    Disable this to avoid building the Opus audio codec.

rtc_include_pulse_audio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:177

    Excluded in Chromium since its prerequisites don't require Pulse Audio.

rtc_include_tests
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:184

    Include tests in standalone checkout.

rtc_initialize_ffmpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:160

    FFmpeg must be initialized for |H264DecoderImpl| to work. This can be done
    by WebRTC during |H264DecoderImpl::InitDecode| or externally. FFmpeg must
    only be initialized once. Projects that initialize FFmpeg externally, such
    as Chromium, must turn this flag off so that WebRTC does not also
    initialize.

rtc_jsoncpp_root
    Current value (from the default) = "//third_party/jsoncpp/source/include"
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:51

    Used to specify an external Jsoncpp include path when not compiling the
    library that comes with WebRTC (i.e. rtc_build_json == 0).

    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:108

    Set to "func", "block", "edge" for coverage generation.
    At unit test runtime set UBSAN_OPTIONS="coverage=1".
    It is recommend to set include_examples=0.
    Use llvm's sancov -html-report for human readable reports.
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html .

rtc_ssl_root
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:55

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/webrtc/webrtc.gni:142

    Enable this to build OpenH264 encoder/FFmpeg decoder. This is supported on
    all platforms except Android and iOS. Because FFmpeg can be built
    with/without H.264 support, |ffmpeg_branding| has to separately be set to a
    value that includes H.264, for example "Chrome". If FFmpeg is built without
    H.264, compilation succeeds but |H264DecoderImpl| fails to initialize. See
    also: |rtc_initialize_ffmpeg|.
    CHECK THE OPENH264, FFMPEG AND H.264 LICENSES/PATENTS BEFORE BUILDING.
    http://www.openh264.org, https://www.ffmpeg.org/

    the build since the symbols are large and dealing with them is slow.
      2 means regular build with symbols.
      1 means minimal symbols, usually enough for backtraces only.
      0 means no symbols.
      -1 means auto-set according to debug/release and platform.

system_libdir
    Current value (from the default) = "lib"
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:44

    CrOS systemroots place pkgconfig files at <systemroot>/usr/share/pkgconfig
    and one of <systemroot>/usr/lib/pkgconfig or <systemroot>/usr/lib64/pkgconfig
    depending on whether the systemroot is for a 32 or 64 bit architecture.
   
    When build under GYP, CrOS board builds specify the 'system_libdir' variable
    as part of the GYP_DEFINES provided by the CrOS emerge build or simple
    chrome build scheme. This variable permits controlling this for GN builds
    in similar fashion by setting the `system_libdir` variable in the build's
    args.gn file to 'lib' or 'lib64' as appropriate for the target architecture.

    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:29

    Default to warnings as errors for default workflow, where we catch
    warnings with known toolchains. Allow overriding this e.g. for Chromium
    builds on Linux that could use a different version of the compiler.
    With GCC, warnings in no-Chromium code are always not treated as errors.

use_dbus
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/features.gni:63

use_debug_fission
    Current value (from the default) = "default"
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:37

    use_debug_fission: whether to use split DWARF debug info
    files. This can reduce link time significantly, but is incompatible
    with some utilities such as icecc and ccache. Requires gold and
    gcc >= 4.8 or clang.
    http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission
   
    This is a placeholder value indicating that the code below should set
    the default.  This is necessary to delay the evaluation of the default
    value expression until after its input values such as use_gold have
    been set, e.g. by a toolchain_args() block.

use_gtk3
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/linux/gtk/gtk.gni:14

    Whether to compile against GTKv3 instead of GTKv2.
    TODO(thomasanderson): Currently, the 32-bit clusterfuzz schroot does not
    have libgtk-3-0 installed.  set use_gtk3 = true on all architectures when
    the package is added (crbug.com/699669).

use_incremental_wpo
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:46

    Whether or not we should turn on incremental WPO. Only affects the VS
    Windows build.

use_kerberos
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //net/features.gni:22

    Enable Kerberos authentication. It is disabled by default on ChromeOS, iOS,
    Chromecast, at least for now. This feature needs configuration (krb5.conf
    and so on).

use_libfuzzer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:76

    Compile for fuzzing with LLVM LibFuzzer.
    See http://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/libfuzzer

use_libjpeg_turbo

      From //third_party/angle/BUILD.gn:15

    Use the PCI lib to collect GPU information on Linux.

use_lld
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:23

    Set to true to use lld, the LLVM linker. This flag may be used on Windows
    with the shipped LLVM toolchain, or on Linux with a self-built top-of-tree
    LLVM toolchain (see llvm_force_head_revision in
    build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn).

use_locally_built_instrumented_libraries
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:46

    Use dynamic libraries instrumented by one of the sanitizers instead of the
    standard system libraries. Set this flag to build the libraries from source.

    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //google_apis/BUILD.gn:31

    You can set the variable 'use_official_google_api_keys' to true
    to use the Google-internal file containing official API keys
    for Google Chrome even in a developer build.  Setting this
    variable explicitly to true will cause your build to fail if the
    internal file is missing.
   
    The variable is documented here, but not handled in this file;
    see //google_apis/determine_use_official_keys.gypi for the
    implementation.
   
    Set the variable to false to not use the internal file, even when
    it exists in your checkout.
   
    Leave it unset or set to "" to have the variable
    implicitly set to true if you have
    src/google_apis/internal/google_chrome_api_keys.h in your
    checkout, and implicitly set to false if not.
   
    Note that official builds always behave as if the variable
    was explicitly set to true, i.e. they always use official keys,
    and will fail to build if the internal file is missing.

use_openh264
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/openh264/openh264_args.gni:11

    Enable this to build OpenH264 (for encoding, not decoding).
    CHECK THE OPENH264 LICENSE/PATENT BEFORE BUILDING, see
    http://www.openh264.org/.

use_ozone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ui.gni:30

    Indicates if Ozone is enabled. Ozone is a low-level library layer for Linux
    that does not require X11. Enabling this feature disables use of glib, x11,
    Pango, and Cairo. Default to false on non-Chromecast builds.

use_partition_alloc
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //base/BUILD.gn:46

    for Cronet to reduce the size of the Cronet binary.

use_prebuilt_instrumented_libraries
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:42

    Use dynamic libraries instrumented by one of the sanitizers instead of the
    standard system libraries. Set this flag to download prebuilt binaries from
    GCS.

use_pulseaudio
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //media/media_options.gni:87

use_rtti
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:86

    Build with C++ RTTI enabled. Chromium builds without RTTI by default,
    but some sanitizers are known to require it, like CFI diagnostics
    and UBsan variants.

use_sanitizer_coverage

use_system_harfbuzz
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/harfbuzz-ng/BUILD.gn:17

    Blink uses a cutting-edge version of Harfbuzz; most Linux distros do not
    contain a new enough version of the code to work correctly. However,
    ChromeOS chroots (i.e, real ChromeOS builds for devices) do contain a
    new enough version of the library, and so this variable exists so that
    ChromeOS can build against the system lib and keep binary sizes smaller.

use_system_libdrm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/libdrm/BUILD.gn:13

    Controls whether the build should use the version of libdrm
    library shipped with the system. In release builds of Chrome OS we
    use the system version, but when building on dev workstations we
    bundle it because Ubuntu doesn't ship a usable version.

use_system_libjpeg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/BUILD.gn:13

    Uses system libjpeg. If true, overrides use_libjpeg_turbo.

use_system_sqlite
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/sqlite/BUILD.gn:11

    Controls whether the build should uses the version of sqlite3 library
    shipped with the system (currently only supported on iOS) or the one
    shipped with Chromium source.

use_system_xcode
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:54

    Use the system install of Xcode for tools like ibtool, libtool, etc.
    This does not affect the compiler. When this variable is false, targets will
    instead use a hermetic install of Xcode. [The hermetic install can be
    obtained with gclient sync after setting the environment variable
    FORCE_MAC_TOOLCHAIN].

use_thin_lto
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:29

    If used with allow_posix_link_time_opt, it enables the experimental support
    of ThinLTO that links 3x-10x faster but (as of now) does not have all the
    important optimizations such us devirtualization implemented. See also
    http://blog.llvm.org/2016/06/thinlto-scalable-and-incremental-lto.html

use_udev
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/features.gni:61

    Indicates if V4L plugin is used.

use_vgem_map
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //ui/ozone/ozone.gni:17

    This enables memory-mapped access to accelerated graphics buffers via the
    VGEM ("virtual GEM") driver. This is currently only available on Chrome OS
    kernels and affects code in the GBM ozone platform.
    TODO(dshwang): remove this flag when all gbm hardware supports vgem map.
    crbug.com/519587

use_vulcanize
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //chrome/common/features.gni:77

    Optimize parts of Chrome's UI written with web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS)
    for runtime performance purposes. This does more work at compile time for
    speed benefits at runtime (so we skip in debug builds). TODO(dbeam): rename
    this flag "optimize_web_uis" because we run more than vulcanize these days.

use_xcode_clang
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:42

    Compile with Xcode version of clang instead of hermetic version shipped
    with the build. Used on iOS to ship official builds (as they are built
    with the version of clang shipped with Xcode).

    Includes files needed for correctness fuzzing.

v8_current_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = "x64"
      From //build/config/v8_target_cpu.gni:60

    This argument is declared here so that it can be overridden in toolchains.
    It should never be explicitly set by the user.

v8_deprecation_warnings
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //v8/BUILD.gn:36

    Enable compiler warnings when using V8_DEPRECATED apis.

    With post mortem support enabled, metadata is embedded into libv8 that
    describes various parameters of the VM for use by debuggers. See
    tools/gen-postmortem-metadata.py for details.

v8_snapshot_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //v8/snapshot_toolchain.gni:34

    The v8 snapshot needs to be built by code that is compiled with a
    toolchain that matches the bit-width of the target CPU, but runs on
    the host.

v8_static_library
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //v8/gni/v8.gni:44

    Use static libraries instead of source_sets.

v8_target_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/v8_target_cpu.gni:33

    This arg is used when we want to tell the JIT-generating v8 code
    that we want to have it generate for an architecture that is different
    than the architecture that v8 will actually run on; we then run the
    code under an emulator. For example, we might run v8 on x86, but
    generate arm code and run that under emulation.
   
    This arg is defined here rather than in the v8 project because we want
    some of the common architecture-specific args (like arm_float_abi or
    mips_arch_variant) to be set to their defaults either if the current_cpu
    applies *or* if the v8_current_cpu applies.
   
    As described below, you can also specify the v8_target_cpu to use
    indirectly by specifying a `custom_toolchain` that contains v8_$cpu in the
    name after the normal toolchain.
   
    For example, `gn gen --args="custom_toolchain=...:clang_x64_v8_arm64"`
    is equivalent to setting --args=`v8_target_cpu="arm64"`. Setting
    `custom_toolchain` is more verbose but makes the toolchain that is
    (effectively) being used explicit.
   
    v8_target_cpu can only be used to target one architecture in a build,
    so if you wish to build multiple copies of v8 that are targetting
    different architectures, you will need to do something more
    complicated involving multiple toolchains along the lines of
    custom_toolchain, above.

v8_test_isolation_mode
    Current value (from the default) = "noop"
      From //v8/gni/isolate.gni:11

    Sets the test isolation mode (noop|prepare|check).

v8_use_external_startup_data
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //v8/gni/v8.gni:34

    Use external files for startup data blobs:
    the JS builtins sources and the start snapshot.

v8_use_mips_abi_hardfloat
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //v8/BUILD.gn:90

win_console_app
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/console_app.gni:12

    If true, builds as a console app (rather than a windowed app), which allows
    logging to be printed to the user. This will cause a terminal window to pop
    up when the executable is not run from the command line, so should only be
    used for development. Only has an effect on Windows builds.
